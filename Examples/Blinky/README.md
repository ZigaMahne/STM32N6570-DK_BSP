# Blinky project

The **Blinky** project is a simple example that can be used to verify the
basic tool setup.

It is compliant to the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS)
and uses the CMSIS-RTOS2 API interface for RTOS functionality. The CMSIS-RTOS2 API
is available with various real-time operating systems, for example RTX5 or FreeRTOS.

## Operation

- At start
    - outputs "Blinky Example" to UART that is connected to ST-Link (baudrate 115200bps)
    - blinks vioLED0 in 1 sec interval.
- The vioBUTTON0 changes the blink frequency and start/stops vioLED1.

### CMSIS-Driver Virtual I/O mapping

| CMSIS-Driver VIO      | Board component
|:----------------------|:--------------------------------------
| vioBUTTON0            | Tamper button (B4)
| vioLED0               | LED Red       (LD2)
| vioLED1               | LED Green     (LD1)

## Build and Load in VSCode

### In Activity bar under CMSIS click **Manage Solution Settings**

- Select **ExtMemLoader** Target Set and click **Build solution**
    - **ExtMemLoader** project should successfully build to have configured flash algorithm (check in root folder if ExtMemLoader.axf file appears)
- Continue with select **FSBL** Target Set
- Ensure **ST-Link@pyOCD** Debug Adapter is selected and **Update launch.json and tasks.json** checkbox is selected and click **Save** then click **Build solution**
    - FSBL project should successfully build into out folder

### Load application to target

- Set the boot mode configuration in **development mode** (BOOT1 switch position to 1-3) and reset board after each power on cycle
- To flash STM32N6570-DK board click **Views and More Actions** and click **Load application to target**
- Set the boot mode configuration in **flash mode** (BOOT1 switch position to 1-2) and reset board
- Configured `LD1_green` (GPIO PO.01) LED should blink (in FSBL/Src/main.c)

## Debug in VSCode

- To debug application in
    - **FLASH MODE**
        - Set the boot mode configuration in **flash mode** (BOOT1 switch position to 1-2) and reset board
          > To flash an unprogrammed (virgin) STM32N6570-DK board, ensure that the board is in development mode (BOOT1 switch position to 1-3).
        - Open `.vscode\launch.json` file and modify configuration named "STLink@pyOCD (launch)" under **initCommands** and **customResetCommands**:
            - Modify the command from **tbreak main** to **thbreak main**
        - Click **Load & Debug application** button and now program should wait in main function to start debug
        - With Continue (F5) button, `LD1_green` (GPIO PO.01) LED should blink in flash mode

    - **DEVELOPMENT MODE**
        - Set the boot mode configuration in **development mode** (BOOT1 switch position to 1-3) and reset board
        - Open `.vscode\launch.json` file and modify configuration named "STLink@pyOCD (launch)"
            - Comment line

            ```jsonc
            // "preLaunchTask": "CMSIS Load",
            ```

            - add commands into initCommands

            ```json
            "initCommands": [
                "monitor reset halt",
                "load out/FSBL/STM32N657X0HxQ/Debug/FSBL.hex",
                "set $pc = Reset_Handler",
                "set $sp = (int) &Image$$ARM_LIB_STACK$$ZI$$Limit",
                "thbreak main"
            ```

            - add commands into customResetCommands

            ```json
            "customResetCommands": [
                "monitor reset halt",
                "maintenance flush register-cache",
                "maintenance flush dcache",
                "load out/FSBL/STM32N657X0HxQ/Debug/FSBL.hex",
                "set $pc = Reset_Handler",
                "set $sp = (int) &Image$$ARM_LIB_STACK$$ZI$$Limit",
                "thbreak main",
                "continue"
            ```

        - Save launch.json
        - Click **Load & Debug application** button and now program should wait in main function to start debug
        - With Continue (F5) button, configured `LD1_green` (GPIO PO.01) LED should blink in development mode
